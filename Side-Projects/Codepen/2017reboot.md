# 2017 Reboot
My codepen was largely ignored after I got bored with taking a web dev class in school. It's 2017 and my adventures in the Front End have led me to interesting pens on many occasions. It's time I up my Codeen game!

## Progress
 * Deleted the old nonsense
 * Reorganized my showcase page.
