Side Projects
=============

Other tech work I have done for people and organizations (often for free). The entries in this folder represent projects that I put in significant time and effort coding, but that I don't/can't have stored in any Github repository.

Some examples are:
  * RFS Dream Team website
  * Class of '19 blog
  * [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Toarch)! (at least 2 commits worth)
