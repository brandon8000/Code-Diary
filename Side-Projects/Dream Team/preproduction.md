# Pre-Production
We are setting up the Dream Team site on the Wordpress backend.

Had a great discussion about the home page and settled on a theme with a strong parallax scrolling effect. Needed to use some basic CSS to change how the team member profile pictures looked.

The next big things we needed were an "About" page and "Contact Us" page. Those were really straightforward. Had to proofread the copy and style with the proper margins and padding.

We are going to have a photoshoot this weekend, so I had to set up each executive team member's profile page. Everybody was more concerned with how their picture will look, than with how the page is laid out, so the basic Wordpress styling was enough for this page.
I also sprinkled in some metadata about the site (title, favicon, etc).

We have a good idea of what photos to use and where. They look amazing. I added them to every person's profile page and created a slider on the homepage.

Fixed up the homepage slider to look pretty decent! Pagination is unobtrusive, navigation arrows are sleek and functional. If only the images would stop resizing the container!

All team members have a photo and profile link on the homepage team list. Now I have to wait for some body copy for our events list and links to our social media pages.

Got the page working with a "hidden" slider to display the corporate logos. We need to launch soon, so I just grabbed the images from the internet.
