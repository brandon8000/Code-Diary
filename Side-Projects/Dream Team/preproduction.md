# Pre-Production
We are setting up the Dream Team site on the Wordpress backend.

Had a great discussion about the home page and settled on a theme with a strong parallax scrolling effect. Needed to use some basic CSS to change how the team member profile pictures looked.

The next big things we needed were an "About" page and "Contact Us" page. Those were really straightforward. Had to proofread the copy and style with the proper margins and padding.

We are going to have a photoshoot this weekend, so I had to set up each executive team member's profile page. Everybody was more concerned with how their picture will look, than with how the page is laid out, so the basic Wordpress styling was enough for this page.
I also sprinkled in some metadata about the site (title, favicon, etc).

We have a good idea of what photos to use and where. They look amazing. I added them to every person's profile page and created a slider on the homepage.

The slider plugin settings failed to do anything useful. Going in on the custom CSS...
