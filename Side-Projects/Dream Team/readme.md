Dream Team Website
===================
The website I'm making for my student organization, the [RFS Dream Team](rfsdreamteam.com). 

## Background
We've been designing prototypes for months using MS paint and online template builders. Now that we have a domain and hosting, it's time to actually implement.

## Details
It's a static site that we'll use to post updates about what we are doing and maybe use during special events, so there isn't a need for some grand web framework. We will use Wordpress to bring our ideas to life and make it easy to maintain for future students.
