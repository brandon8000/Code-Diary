An excellent introduction to the basics of web development by Udacity and some people from Google.

Today I worked for 2 hours and completed about half of the course. I was able to use basic tags like `<body>` and `span` to make a Hello World page with lots of text and even a few `<img>`s thrown in there. It was possible to view the results of my code live by using Chrome's dev tools!

Finished the main course content by watching another set of excellent videos. Learning about CSS for custom styling. Styled my own buttons, then used Bootstrap to do it for me! The boxify design model was very new to me but seems useful.

Playing around with the sample project of building a portfolio. Achieved the targeted layout and filled the space with dummy text and images.

I got the hang of HTML and CSS to make a few silly pages. Looked up documentation on different tags and style properties. Moving on to the W3School website to learn about JavaScript.
